  "incidentDescription": "At 4:23 AM UTC, a coordinated attack across three Avalanche subnets resulted in the largest cross-chain exploit in DeFi history. 15.7 million AVAX, 45 million USDC, and 2,800 BTC vanished through a sophisticated MEV manipulation combined with subnet validator collusion. The attack used flash loans across multiple chains, manipulated cross-chain bridge oracles, and exploited a zero-day vulnerability in subnet consensus mechanisms. Total estimated damage: $89 million.",
